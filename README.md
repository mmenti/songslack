Episode 1 in my "teach yourself Go" series: a simple script that checks Songkick events for new track/going events,
and posts these to a Slack channel.

It's probably awful, since it's the first thing I've ever written in Go, with no input from anyone who knows what they're doing..

Not sure if there will be more episodes ;)
